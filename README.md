# Hand-Writing Retrieval by 123 of AI
Welcome to our Handwriting Recognition project. In a digital age, we believe that the beauty of handwriting shouldn't be lost. Our mission is to bring the art of handwriting into the digital world by creating a powerful recognition system that understands and interprets the nuances of human writing.

## Introduction
In this project, we embark on a mission to breathe new life into the world of handwritten text. Our goal is to seamlessly transition handwritten content into a digital format while preserving the unique charm of individual handwriting styles. Join us as we introduce two innovative methods that bring precision and adaptability to handwriting recognition.

## Methods
Our project leverages two distinctive methods:
- **Method 1: Cosine Distances for Precision**
  - Focuses on the structural aspects of handwriting.
  - Delivers precise recognition.

- **Method 2: L2 Distances for Versatility**
  - Adaptable to various handwriting styles and variations.
  - Captures the diversity of writing styles.

## Why We Strive for Better
Existing handwriting recognition methods have their limitations. We're determined to overcome these challenges by continually improving recognition accuracy, handling handwriting variability, and creating a more adaptable system.

## Future Directions
Our journey doesn't end here; we have exciting future directions ahead:
- Enhancing existing models and features.
- Exploring advanced techniques for variable-length features.
- Incorporating Dynamic Time Warping for handling temporal variations.
- Venturing into feature extraction methods like HOG, SIFT, and SURF.
- Experimenting with ensemble models and the Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) technique.

## Project Status
- Our commitment to continuous improvement drives us.
